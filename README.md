## Features

- üîê **User Management** - Register users and switch between accounts
- üì° **RSS Feed Management** - Add, list, and manage RSS feeds
- üë• **Social Following** - Follow feeds created by other users
- ü§ñ **Auto-Aggregation** - Continuous RSS feed scraping and post storage
- üì∞ **Post Browsing** - View recent posts from your followed feeds
- üóÑÔ∏è **Database Storage** - Persistent storage of users, feeds, and posts

## Prerequisites

Before installing Gator, make sure you have:

- **Go 1.24+** - [Download and install Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **PostgreSQL** - [Download and install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- **Goose** - Database migration tool (installation instructions below)

## Installation

Install Gator using Go's built-in package manager:

```bash
go install github.com/voidarchive/Gator@latest
```

This will compile and install the `gator` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory (usually `~/go/bin`).

Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system's `$PATH` so you can run `gator` from anywhere.

## Setup

### 1. Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database for Gator:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE gator;
```

### 2. Install Goose (Database Migration Tool)

Install goose for running database migrations:

```bash
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```

### 3. Run Database Migrations

Navigate to the Gator project directory and run the migrations:

```bash
cd sql/schema
goose postgres "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable" up
```

Replace `username`, `password`, and connection details with your PostgreSQL credentials.

This will create all the necessary tables:
- `users` - User accounts
- `feeds` - RSS feed information  
- `feed_follows` - User feed subscriptions
- `posts` - Scraped RSS posts

### 4. Configuration File

Create a configuration file at `~/.gatorconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable",
  "current_user_name": ""
}
```

Replace `username`, `password`, and database connection details with your PostgreSQL credentials.

## Usage

### User Management

```bash
# Register a new user
gator register <username>

# Login as a user (sets current user)
gator login <username>

# List all users
gator users

# Reset database (delete all users)
gator reset
```

### Feed Management

```bash
# Add a new RSS feed (automatically follows it)
gator addfeed "Feed Name" "https://example.com/rss"

# List all feeds in the system
gator feeds

# Follow an existing feed by URL
gator follow "https://example.com/rss"

# List feeds you're following
gator following

# Unfollow a feed
gator unfollow "https://example.com/rss"
```

### Post Aggregation & Browsing

```bash
# Start RSS aggregation (runs continuously)
gator agg <duration>

# Examples:
gator agg 1m     # Fetch feeds every 1 minute
gator agg 30s    # Fetch feeds every 30 seconds
gator agg 1h     # Fetch feeds every 1 hour

# Browse recent posts from followed feeds
gator browse          # Show 2 most recent posts (default)
gator browse 10       # Show 10 most recent posts
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Register and login
gator register alice
gator login alice

# 2. Add some RSS feeds
gator addfeed "TechCrunch" "https://techcrunch.com/feed/"
gator addfeed "Hacker News" "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss"

# 3. Start aggregating posts (in background)
gator agg 5m &

# 4. Browse recent posts
gator browse 5

# 5. Follow feeds from other users
gator follow "https://blog.boot.dev/index.xml"
```
